    > Add monitoring loop to UWifiServerMain class to check threads status
    > if all threads are stopped, then destroy\create threads
    > otherwise it hangs

    > Location note for monitor
    > Data must be checked by zones

17/01/11    ADDED
    > Add new monitor to DB.wifi_monitors
    > Save locally this monitor data to exclude excessive I\O to DB, i.e. 
    >  monitor_mac is UNIQUE, so there is no need to save it each time.

    > Averages received data for 1 second. And saves aggregated value to the DB.
    > Parses server configuration from external .conf file. If no such exist
    >   uses config packaged inside /resources folder.
